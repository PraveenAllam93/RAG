## **Snow: Chatbot Application Specification**

### **1. Introduction**

**Snow** is an advanced chatbot application designed to leverage the power of large language models (LLMs) for processing a wide array of input types and performing a variety of tasks. Built using FastAPI for the backend and Svelte for the frontend, Snow aims to deliver a robust and interactive user experience. This document outlines the key features, technologies, and functionalities of Snow.

### **2. Technology Stack**

- **Backend**: FastAPI
  - Provides a high-performance API framework to handle server-side logic and integration with LLM models.
- **Frontend**: Svelte
  - Offers a modern, reactive framework for building a user-friendly interface.
- **LLM Models**: 
  - Utilized to process and generate responses based on different input types such as images, text, files, videos, and audio.

### **3. Features and Functionalities**

**Snow** incorporates a diverse set of features to cater to various user needs:

1. **Input Handling**
   - **Images**:
     - Analyze and process image inputs to extract text, classify images, and identify errors.
     - Use Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for text extraction and apply image classification models to detect issues.
   - **Text**:
     - Understand and generate responses to text input using advanced natural language processing techniques.
   - **Files**:
     - Interpret and handle different file types, including documents and spreadsheets.
     - Extract relevant information and perform actions based on file contents.
   - **Videos**:
     - Process video inputs to extract key information and provide relevant insights.
     - Employ video analysis models to identify content and detect issues.
   - **Audio**:
     - Convert audio input into text using speech-to-text models.
     - Analyze audio content for context and respond accordingly.

2. **Functionalities**
   - **Task Execution**:
     - Perform user-defined tasks based on the type of input and the context of the request.
   - **Application Deployment**:
     - Facilitate the deployment of the Snow application to ensure it is accessible and functional for end-users.
   - **Email Sending**:
     - Enable the application to send emails with image attachments, allowing users to share or report issues effectively.
   - **Error Detection**:
     - Detect and report errors found in image inputs, providing actionable feedback to users.
   - **Incident Management**:
     - **Raise Incident Tickets**:
       - Generate and log incident tickets for reported issues, enabling efficient tracking and resolution.
     - **Solve Incident Tickets**:
       - Manage and resolve incident tickets by providing solutions or escalating as necessary.

### **4. Workflow**

1. **User Interaction**:
   - Users interact with the Snow application through a Svelte-based frontend interface, where they can input text, images, files, videos, or audio.
   - The frontend captures user input and sends it to the FastAPI backend for processing.

2. **Data Processing**:
   - The FastAPI backend receives input data and routes it to the appropriate LLM model based on the input type.
   - LLM models process the data, perform necessary actions, and generate responses or outputs.

3. **Output and Actions**:
   - Processed results are sent back to the frontend, where users receive feedback and information.
   - The application performs additional actions as required, such as sending emails or managing incident tickets.

### **5. Implementation Details**

- **Backend (FastAPI)**:
  - Develop robust API endpoints to handle various types of input and integrate with LLM models.
  - Manage application deployment processes and handle email functionalities.
  - Ensure secure and efficient processing of user data.

- **Frontend (Svelte)**:
  - Design a responsive and intuitive user interface for seamless interaction.
  - Implement features for data input, result display, and status updates.
  - Ensure a smooth user experience with real-time feedback and interaction.

### **6. Future Enhancements**

- **Model Integration**:
  - Incorporate additional LLM models to enhance processing capabilities and support more input types.
- **Expanded Input Support**:
  - Increase the range of supported file formats and input types for greater flexibility.
- **Advanced Incident Management**:
  - Introduce more sophisticated features for incident tracking and resolution.

### **7. Conclusion**

**Snow** is poised to be a comprehensive chatbot application that addresses a wide range of user needs through advanced LLM technology. By combining FastAPI and Svelte, Snow will offer a powerful, user-centric solution capable of handling diverse input types and performing essential tasks. This document provides a foundational overview, and further details will be developed as the project progresses.
